		<h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
		<p class="context">
			The <span class="highlight"> Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) </span> study program is planned to take shelter in the
        	management of the <span class="highlight"> Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous
        	statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will
			<br>
			<br>
			 produce graduates who are <span class="highlight"> prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs </span>. So, it would be better if PTIK
       		 was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="highlight"> Building Engineering Education </span>, and
        	<span class="highlight"> Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that
        	cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="highlight"> resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
